## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Through JavaScript we have the ability to manipulate the DOM. Every single time you click on a button, the app is going to render the change through javascript and can see the change to the HTML in the browser.

## Lessons Learned:
Front end is fun!!!
Whats Happening? We create a list in our HTML to hold our "couples".
In our JS file we add an onclick event for each list item.
Each list item will be a couple you can "pick".

when you click a list item (a couples name) something funny happens

ex: document.getElementById('kim-usman').onclick = kimUsman 

A function should be listening for that 'click' event and then run a function that changes the background, adds an image of the couple, the couples name, location, age, and story. These changes will render to the page after you click an item in the list.

I hope you found it entertaining or fun. There is a lot to clean up / refactor, but I wanted to get something up in one night.

The DOM API allows for  quick and efficient builds, it's a great tool for frontend/ UI experience!
The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually it refers to JavaScript.

A document containing HTML is described using the Document interface, which is extended by the HTML specification to include various HTML-specific features. In particular, the Element interface is enhanced to become HTMLElement and various subclasses, each representing one of (or a family of closely related) elements.
